Bit manipulation

A smattering of C programming operators provide data manipulation at the binary level. The operators are easy to ignore, but only when their true power and usefulness are not appreciated.

The ~ and ! operators
Two infrequent binary operators are the ~ (or 1 complement) and the ! (or NOT). They lack the charm of the logical bitwise operators, but they have a place.

The 1 complement operator flips all the bits in a value, turning a 1 into a 0 and a 0 into a 1. 

Zero and 1 are the only two results possible when using the bitwise ! operator.
